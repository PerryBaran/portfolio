                        Created by Nicola and I as our final project at Command Shift.
                        The app is a React SPA that interacts with an Express.js API that uses Sequelize and Postgres to run a relational database.
                        Images and audio files are stored in an AWS S3 Bucket.
                        During development, I was responsible for creating the backend, linking the backend and frontend together, creating the music player and search
                        functionality, creating the home, search and profile feeds, adding the edit album and profile forms and styling the app.
